## Chess
Created by Ari Weitzman and Tom Bescherer

## How to Use
To begin a game, clone the repo and navigate to its path in your terminal window. Then type:
```linux
$ ruby index.rb
```
Choose a name for each player and then begin playing! Moves take the format of "start move-end move" (i.e. "A2-A4").

The game also allows users to save one board state for future use. To save a game state at any time, when prompted for a move just type "save":
```linux
A (white): Enter start and end position, divided by a dash: save
```
To load a previously saved board, type "load":
```linux
T (black): Enter start and end position, divided by a dash: load
```

## Technologies
This rendition of Chess is written entirely in Ruby. To add color to the board, we employed the colorize gem.

To simplify movement among the pieces, we created a base Piece class from which all other pieces inherited. This allowed us to avoid redundancy in our code.

In order to evaluate whether a move is valid or not, the program simulates future board states based on the proposed move. If the move would put the moving player in check, or does not obey the rules of movement for the moving piece, we reject the move. To accomplish the future board simulation, we deep dup the board and raise an error to alert the user that the proposed move is not a valid one.

To save board states, we used YAML. The program converts the Board's grid attribute object to YAML and saves it as a text file. When the user loads a game, the program reconstitutes this grid from YAML and passes it to the Game instance.

## Requirements
There are two outside gems required
1. byebug
1. colorize

If you have _bundler_, you can install them with
```
bundle install
```
because they are specified in the Gemfile
